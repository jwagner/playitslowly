Play it slowly Manual
=====================

About
=====
'Play it slowly' is a tool to help you when practicing or
transcribing music. It allows you to play a piece of music
at a different speed or pitch.


Shortcuts
=========
The following keyboard shortcuts exist:
 * Alt + P or SPACE: Play/Pause
 * Alt + e: Rewind
 * CTRL + 1-9: Rewind (x seconds)


Selecting the audio output device
=================================
You can select which audiodevice playitslowly uses by passing
a gstreamer sink with the --sink commandline parameter.

Example:
playitslowly "--sink=alsasink device=plughw:GT10"
or
playitslowly "--sink=alsasink device=hw:1"

You can also use other sinks than alsa.


Generic Installation
====================
To install use you need to have the following libraries installed:

 * Python 2.6 (or 2.5 with simplejson installed)
 * PyGTK >= 2.10
 * PyGST >= 0.10
 * gstreamer >= 0.10 including the soundtouch/pitch element
   (included in gstreamer-plugins-bad)

Normally these libraries are already installed on your system.

To install play it slowly execute: ``python setup.py install`` as 
superuser (root). If you are using a gnome based system like Ubuntu
you can just doubleclick ``install.sh`` and select run.


Distribution Specific Installation Hints
========================================

Arch Linux
----------
(this could be obsolete by now)

Arch Linux is missing the pitch element, so you'll have to compile
yourself::

    pacman -S soundtouch
    cd /tmp
    wget gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-bad/gst-plugins-bad-0.10.9.tar.gz
    tar xzf gst-plugins-bad-0.10.9.tar.gz
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    cd ext/soundtouch
    make && make install 

Then test if it worked::

    gst-inspect-0.10 soundtouch

Fedora
------
Install gstreamer-plugins-bad-extras

Mandriva
--------
Install gstreamer0.10-soundtouch.

Ubuntu
------
It should work out of the box!
